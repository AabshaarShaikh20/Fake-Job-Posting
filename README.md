In recent years, the rise of online job portals and platforms has provided job seekers with a convenient and efficient means of finding employment opportunities. However, this digital transformation has also given rise to a growing concern: the proliferation of fake job postings. 
These deceptive listings can mislead and exploit job seekers, wasting their time and potentially exposing them to fraudulent activities.


This project aims to solve this problem by identifying wheather it is Fake or Not..
